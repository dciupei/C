Project: The Durand-Kerner Method-dk.cDavid CiupeiCiupei_david@yahoo.com	David.ciupei@wsu.edu	This code dk.c will use the coefficients read in from stdin and compute the roots at each iteration until the root is close to the solution. What I use to read the coefficients is first I compile the code by typing “gcc -g -std=c99 -Wall dk.c -o dk –lm” then I would have for example the values of p5 in a file called p5.in. I would then input “./dk < p5.in” and the coefficients are then passed through the code to compute the roots and print them out on the command line. For each root the radius and the initial guesses need to be found. Then using the Durand-Kerner iterative algorithm (which converges on the n roots of the polynomial f(z)) the iterations and roots will be printed out. The amount of iterations that it needs to take can be determined by when the max is close to the epsilon value 10^-6.
