Run / Build:

To run the program I have attached a Makefile in the folder. Simply open terminal and change directory to the folder. run the command 'make' then type './Producer-Consumer (sleep time) (number of producers) (number of consumers)' and the program will start running. To stop the program press 'CTRL-c' and the program will exit in the time entered.
