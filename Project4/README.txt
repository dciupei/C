Description:
	This program is used to solve linear equations of the form Ax = b using LU decomposition. The LU decompostion also uses partial pivoting to avoid the situation when Bjj is equal to 0. This program also has a solve method that can solve each triangular system. It solves it using forward substitution and also back substitution. To run the program there is a Makefile and on the command line you type in 'make' then type in  './LUtest' and that will run tests on the program making sure everything is working.
