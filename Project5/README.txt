Description:
	This project uses LUdecomposition for solving linear equations of the form Ax=b. This program will discover a transformation that maps the pixels of an image. The type of transformation that is being used is called homography. To run this program you have to type in "make" then after it compiles type in ./homography < boxtop.in this will display the boxtop.out numbers. To see the image be transformed type in ./homography < boxtop.in | ./hmap cheerios-small.ppm 500 650 > face.jpg then open the image to see the transformed image. If you use the shelves picture the previous like of code can be ran just change the pictures from cheerios to the shelves picture.
